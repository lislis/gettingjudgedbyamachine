# My first time getting judged by a machine

Little thing build with [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/).

Have MobileNet classify your face for funs and giggles! Will request camera access. Don't take it too seriously, tough.

## Setup

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` and then start a local webserver. Voila!

## Why is there /data?

Originally I also wanted to use Word2Vec to have a witty response go with the judgement. But it didn't work out, maybe in the future.

## Thanks

Thanks to [edap](https://github.com/edap) for introducing me to this!
